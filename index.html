    I think everyone knows about <I>GLOBAL WARNING.</I>And also about it has affected our lives. If we do not wake up today, it may be too late tommorow. Nature is in our hands. We can make our world into a heaven or make it like hell. We need to take care of it like it is our baby but we treat it like it is a dustbin. Nowadays, if you look into a river, you will not see clear waters that reflect sunlight but only neverending plastic packets and bottles, sometimes even including the offerings given to God. Even looking at our surroundings, we can see overflowing dustbins and waste everywhere. </p>  
    <section><h3><i>Our role</i></h3></section>
    <p>Nature has left it up to us to be either the heroes or villians in her story. But for the sake of our future generations, we need to stop being the villians. I also have a long way to go to become a hero and protect our nature, but I am learning slowly. So I say, it is the time for all of us to realise the importance of our nature and take steps to protect it.</p>
    <big><div><u>THE STEPS WE CAN TAKE</u></div></big><BR>
    <pre> <div>   1. Stop using plastic bags and use Eco-friendly bags 
    2. Do not put everything in one dustbin, sort your waste in wet, dry and plastic before throwing it out.
    3. Take food, only as much as you can eat. Do not unnecessarily waste food or water.
    4. Try to reuse and recycle your belongings like clothes, furnitures, electronic goods etc.
    5. Most importantly, plant trees as much as you can as they are our future lifelines.
    6. Finally, worship and respect nature.</div></pre>

The environment is the foundation of all life on Earth. It includes air, water, soil, plants, animals, and the natural resources that sustain human existence. Without a healthy environment, survival becomes impossible. Therefore, protecting and preserving it is our greatest responsibility.
1. Source of Life
The environment provides us with essential elements such as oxygen to breathe, water to drink, food to eat, and land to live on. All living beings depend on it directly or indirectly for survival.
2. Balance of Ecosystem
Forests, rivers, oceans, and wildlife maintain ecological balance. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, while animals and plants interact in a cycle that sustains life. Destroying one part of the environment affects the entire ecosystem.
3. Economic Importance
Natural resources like minerals, forests, and fossil fuels contribute to industries, agriculture, and economic development. A degraded environment reduces productivity and growth.
4. Human Health
Clean air, pure water, and unpolluted surroundings are vital for good health. Environmental pollution leads to diseases such as asthma, cancer, and heart problems. Preserving the environment ensures healthier lives.
5. Climate Regulation
Forests, oceans, and the atmosphere regulate the Earthâ€™s temperature and weather patterns. Human activities like deforestation and excessive use of fossil fuels disturb this balance, causing global warming and climate change.
Conclusion
The environment is not just a resource; it is our life-support system. Protecting it means protecting ourselves and future generations. Small steps like planting trees, reducing waste, and saving water can make a big difference. A clean and healthy environment leads to a sustainable and prosperous future.
